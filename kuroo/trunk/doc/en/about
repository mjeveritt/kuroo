Vision

Kuroo is a graphical frontend to Portage, a package management system that allows great flexibility while installing and maintaining software on Gentoo Linux. Kuroo integrates into the K-Desktop-Environment and covers most common maintenance tasks on Portage based systems.
Our project vision in detail:

    * Kuroo is easy to use
      The main functions of Kuroo are easily understandable and must work out-of-the-box without any further reading or third-party help.
    * Kuroo is supportive
      The interface guides the user to manage all basic portage maintenance tasks.
    * Kuroo is stable
      Kuroo is a solid application that can be trusted. It is well known for its reliability.

To ensure the best user experience there is, Kuroo cooperates closely with usability specialists from OpenUsability.org.
