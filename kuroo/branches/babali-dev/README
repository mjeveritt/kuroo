I have problem to build with cmake but i don't know why, it should work.

To build with CMake :

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


To build with KDevelop3 with CMake :

mkdir kdevelop
cd kdevelop
cmake -GKDevelop3 ..


You can tweak debug output in ./CMakeLists.txt bye changing to OFF
SET(CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE ON)
SET(CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE ON)
